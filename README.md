* twitter auth callback:
  - fetch identity.
  - if identity exists 
    - and identity's user exists -- sign in as that user
    - and user signed in         -- pair identity with that user
    - else                       -- 




According to our [typography study](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/08/20/typographic-design-survey-best-practices-from-the-best-blogs/):
* Line height (in pixels) ÷ body copy font size (in pixels) = 1.48 -- 1.5 is commonly recommended in classic typographic books, so our study backs up this rule of thumb. Very few websites use anything less than this. And the number of websites that go over 1.48 decreases as you get further from this value.
* Line length (pixels) ÷ line height (pixels) = 27.8               -- The average line length is 538.64 pixels (excluding margins and padding), which is pretty large considering that many websites still have body copy that is 12 to 13 pixels in font size.
* Space between paragraphs (pixels) ÷ line height (pixels) = 0.754 -- It turns out that paragraph spacing (i.e. the space between the last line of one paragraph and the first line of the next) rarely equals the leading (which would be the main characteristic of perfect vertical rhythm). More often, paragraph spacing is just 75% of paragraph leading. The reason may be that leading usually includes the space taken up by descenders; and because most characters do not have descenders, additional white space is created under the line.
* Optimal number of characters per line is 55 to 75                -- According to classic typographic books, the optimal number of characters per line is between 55 and 75, but between 75 and 85 characters per line is more popular in practice.
* Heading font size ÷ Body copy font size = 1.96                   -- When you have chosen a font size for your body copy, you may want to multiply it by 2 to get your heading font size. This, of course, depends on your style; the rule of thumb won’t necessarily give you the optimal size for your particular design. Another option is to use a traditional scale (6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 16, 18, 21, 24, 36, 48, 60, 72) or the Fibonacci sequence (e.g. 16 – 24 – 40 – 64 – 104) to get natural typographic results.

According to our [web form study](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/07/04/web-form-design-patterns-sign-up-forms/)
* The registration link is titled “sign up” (40%) and is placed in the upper-right corner.
* Sign-up forms have simple layouts, to avoid distracting users (61%).
* Titles of input fields are bolded (62%), and fields are vertically arranged more than they are horizontally arranged (86%).
* Designers tend to include few mandatory fields and few optional fields.
* Email confirmation is not given (82%), but password confirmation is (72%).
* The “Submit” button is either left-aligned (56%) or centered (26%).

More:
* COMBAT SPAM BY HIDING A TEXT FIELD WITH JAVASCRIPT, INSTEAD OF USING CAPTCHA -- If you get a lot of spam, then putting a CAPTCHA on your form may be necessary. What’s not necessary is making the CAPTCHA an obstacle that turns users away. Traditional CAPTCHAs that ask users to retype distorted letters have been proven to hurt conversion rates. With the extra hassle they force on users, it’s no wonder.
* USE A QUESTION MARK ICON FOR THE PASSWORD RECOVERY LINK -- Users should have no trouble finding the password recovery link on your form. Instead of using a “Forgot your password” link, consider using a simple question mark button, which won’t take up a lot of room or get lost among other links. Because the question mark is a universal symbol for help, users will not wonder where to go when they’re having password trouble.
* MAKE THE “SUBMIT” BUTTON AS WIDE AS THE TEXT FIELDS -- The log-in button isn’t just for taking action: it also lets users know what action they’re about to take. A small log-in button has weak affordance and can make users feel uncertain about logging in. A wide button gives users more confidence and is hard to miss. The button’s label also becomes more visible, so that users are clearer about the action they’re taking.
